ToDo List App
This is a simple ToDo List application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks. Tasks are saved locally using localStorage so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

2. Edit Task: Click the edit icon next to a task to edit its text.
3. Mark as Done: Click the circle icon next to a task to mark it as done. Click again to undo.
